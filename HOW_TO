for creating a post create .ipynb and ipynb-meta file in /content
  title -   title of the post
  slug  -   path at which the post will be accessed on the server
            the slug first-post will be served at www.yourblog.com/first-post
  ...(rest is self-explanatory)

to start a jupyter server to dynamically edit and run the ipynb file:
  jupyter notebook

to generate static pages to see served locally run:
  pelican content in /github_blog

to serve files locally run:
  python -m pelican.server

to generate files to push to github:
  pelican content -s publihconf.py

for delpoyment to github:
(this moves the files from output to the root in master)
  ghp-import output -b master (after first time use ghp-import?)
  git push origin master
